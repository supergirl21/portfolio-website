            <h4>Engineering Manager, AnnieCannonsâ€™ ResourceFull app</h4>
            <p>
              Supergirl is a multi-talented developer I had the great fortune
              and pleasure of working with in our ResourceFull development team.
              Her facility with visual collaboration software, keen perception
              of user experience, and solution-oriented approach to code
              clarified the user flow diagram and the resulting functionality to
              be built in our React Native mobile app. Her timely questions led
              us to build a product with a quicker, smoother, and more logical
              onboarding process. I look forward to her continued success!

              The simple and intuitive design makes it easy for me use. I highly
              recommend Fetch to my peers.
