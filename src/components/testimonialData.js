Her facility with visual collaboration software, keen perception of user experience, and solution-oriented approach to code clarified the user flow diagram and the resulting functionality to be built in our React Native mobile app. Her timely questions led us to build a product with a quicker, smoother, and more logical onboarding process. I look forward to her continued success!",

      "I have been working with Dona Gino for just under three years now. I have been lucky enough to get to know her in many capacities - as her instructor, teammate, and technical lead. Dona is always the hardest worker on the team. She consistently strives to do her best possible work, and her love of learning is inspiring to those around her. During boot camp, there were times Dona would help me teach her classmates complex concepts in JavaScript and React. As tech lead, I always assigned Dona the most challenging tickets with full confidence in her ability to complete them on time, even when they required her to learn new skills. Dona is kind, humble, dependable, and brilliant. She will not squander any opportunity that comes her way and I give her my full recommendation.",
